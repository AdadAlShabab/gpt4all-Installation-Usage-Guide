## GPT4All: An ecosystem of open-source on-edge large language models.
GPT4All is an ecosystem to train and deploy **powerful** and **customized** large language models that run locally on consumer grade CPUs. Note that your CPU needs to support [AVX or AVX2 instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions).

Learn more in the [documentation](https://docs.gpt4all.io).

The goal is simple - be the best instruction tuned assistant-style language model that any person or enterprise can freely use, distribute and build on.

A GPT4All model is a 3GB - 8GB file that you can download and plug into the GPT4All open-source ecosystem software. **Nomic AI** supports and maintains this software ecosystem to enforce quality and security alongside spearheading the effort to allow any person or enterprise to easily train and deploy their own on-edge large language models. 


### Chat Client
Run any GPT4All model natively on your home desktop with the auto-updating desktop chat client. See <a href="https://gpt4all.io">GPT4All Website</a> for a full list of open-source models you can run with this powerful desktop application.
